## Purpose

Generate a high-level project context document that provides a clear, concise overview of the project's purpose, features, and technology stack for quick understanding.

## Input Requirements

Before using this prompt, gather:

- **Project Concept**: Core idea and problem being solved
- **Key Features**: Main functionality and user benefits
- **Target Users**: Primary audience and use cases
- **Technology Preferences**: Preferred frameworks, AI models, platforms
- **Project Goals**: Success criteria and objectives

## AI Prompt

```
I need to create a concise project context document for a new AI project. Please generate a clear overview based on this information:

**PROJECT CONCEPT**: [Describe the core idea and problem you're solving]

**KEY FEATURES**: [List the main features and capabilities]

**TARGET USERS**: [Describe who will use this system and how]

**TECHNOLOGY PREFERENCES**: [Mention preferred AI models, frameworks, or platforms]

**PROJECT GOALS**: [What success looks like for this project]

Please create a project context document that includes:

1. **Project Title & Description**: Clear, engaging project name and one-paragraph description
2. **Key Features**: Bulleted list of main features with brief explanations
3. **Technology Overview**: High-level technology stack and AI components
4. **Target Outcome**: What the finished project will accomplish

Format requirements:
- Keep it concise (under 100 lines)
- Use clear, non-technical language for the overview
- Include relevant emojis for visual appeal
- Structure it as a markdown document
- Make it accessible to both technical and non-technical stakeholders

The document should serve as a quick reference that anyone can read to understand:
- What the project does
- Why it's valuable
- How it works at a high level
- What technologies it uses

Use the AI Video Generator context.md as a reference for tone and structure, but adapt the content to your specific project domain.
```

## Expected Output

- A complete context.md file ready for your project repository
- Concise project overview that communicates value clearly
- High-level technology summary for quick understanding
- Accessible description for both technical and business stakeholders

## Usage Tips

1. Focus on user benefits rather than technical features
2. Use simple language that non-developers can understand
3. Include compelling use cases or examples
4. Mention unique advantages or differentiators
5. Keep technical details minimal - save depth for architecture doc
6. Make it engaging and easy to scan quickly
