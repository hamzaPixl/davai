# ðŸ“‹ Project Overview Prompt

## Purpose

Generate a comprehensive project overview document that defines the core concept, features, and value proposition of an AI project.

## Input Requirements

Before using this prompt, gather:

- **Project Idea**: Your core concept or problem to solve
- **Target Users**: Who will use this system
- **Key Features**: Main functionality you want to include
- **Technology Preferences**: Any specific AI models, frameworks, or platforms
- **Success Metrics**: How you'll measure project success

## AI Prompt

```
I want to create a comprehensive project overview document for a new AI project. Please generate a well-structured overview document based on this project idea:

**PROJECT IDEA**: [Describe your project concept, the problem it solves, and the target audience]

**KEY FEATURES**: [List the main features and capabilities you want]

**TECHNOLOGY PREFERENCES**: [Mention any specific AI models, frameworks, or platforms you prefer]

**TARGET USERS**: [Describe who will use this system]

**SUCCESS METRICS**: [How will you measure if the project is successful]

Please create a project overview document that includes:

1. **Project Title & Tagline**: Catchy name and one-line description
2. **Problem Statement**: Clear definition of the problem being solved
3. **Solution Overview**: High-level description of how the AI system solves the problem
4. **Key Features**: Detailed list of main features with brief descriptions
5. **Target Audience**: User personas and use cases
6. **Value Proposition**: Why this solution is better than alternatives
7. **Technology Stack**: Recommended AI models, frameworks, and tools
8. **Success Metrics**: Measurable goals and KPIs
9. **Project Scope**: What's included and what's not (MVP vs future features)
10. **Risk Assessment**: Potential challenges and mitigation strategies

Format the output as a professional markdown document with clear sections, emojis for visual appeal, and tables where appropriate. Make it comprehensive enough that a developer can understand the entire project vision from this document alone.

Use the successful AI Video Generator project as inspiration for structure and quality, but adapt the content to the new project domain.
```

## Expected Output

- A complete context.md file ready for your project repository
- Clear project definition that enables autonomous development
- Professional documentation that communicates the vision effectively
- Structured format that follows proven patterns

## Usage Tips

1. Be specific about your project idea - vague descriptions lead to generic outputs
2. Include examples of similar systems if they exist
3. Mention any unique constraints or requirements
4. Specify if this is a consumer app, enterprise tool, API service, etc.
5. Include any integration requirements with existing systems
