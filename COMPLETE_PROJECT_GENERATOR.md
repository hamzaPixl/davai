# ðŸš€ Complete Project Generator - Interactive Workflow

## Purpose

This is a single, comprehensive prompt that captures your project idea, gathers all necessary details through interactive questions, and then generates ALL project documentation in one workflow.

## How to Use

1. **Start with your project idea** - Just provide a brief description of what you want to build
2. **Answer the follow-up questions** - The AI will ask for specific details needed for comprehensive documentation
3. **Receive complete documentation set** - All 7 documents will be generated and ready for your repository

## Master Prompt

```
I want to create a complete AI project documentation set using an interactive workflow. Here's my project idea:

**PROJECT IDEA**: [Describe your project concept in 1-2 sentences - what problem does it solve and who is it for?]

Please help me create comprehensive project documentation by first asking me clarifying questions, then generating all the necessary documents.

WORKFLOW:
1. First, ask me 8-10 specific questions to gather all the information needed for complete documentation
2. Wait for my answers before proceeding
3. Then generate ALL 7 documentation files based on my responses

The questions should cover:
- Target users and use cases
- Key features and functionality
- Performance and scale requirements
- Team size and technical expertise
- Budget constraints and timeline
- Technology preferences (if any)
- Security and compliance needs
- Integration requirements
- Success metrics and goals

After I answer your questions, please generate these complete documents:

1. **context.md** - Project overview and value proposition
2. **architecture.md** - System architecture and component design
3. **tech-stack-selection.md** - Technology choices with detailed analysis
4. **TASK_BREAKDOWN.md** - Complete implementation roadmap
5. **project-rules.md** - Development standards and conventions
6. **CLAUDE.md** - Claude Code integration guide
7. **README.md** - Main project documentation

Each document should be:
- Complete and ready to use
- Professionally formatted with markdown
- Consistent across all files
- Detailed enough for autonomous development
- Based on proven patterns from successful AI projects

Make the documents comprehensive so that a development team can immediately start implementation with clear guidance on architecture, technology choices, and development standards.

Start by asking me the clarifying questions about my project idea.
```

## Expected Interaction Flow

1. **You provide**: Brief project idea (1-2 sentences)
2. **AI asks**: 8-10 specific questions about requirements, constraints, goals
3. **You answer**: All questions in one response
4. **AI generates**: Complete set of 7 documentation files
5. **You receive**: Ready-to-use project repository documentation

## Benefits

- âœ… **Single Session**: Complete documentation in one AI conversation
- âœ… **No Missing Details**: Comprehensive questions ensure nothing is overlooked
- âœ… **Consistent Output**: All documents reference the same project details
- âœ… **Ready for Development**: Immediate implementation-ready documentation
- âœ… **Time Efficient**: 15-30 minutes from idea to complete docs

## Example Usage

```
